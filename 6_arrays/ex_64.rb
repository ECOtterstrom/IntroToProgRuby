  # 5_arrays exercise 4
  
  arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]
  
  1. arr.index(5)
  
  # returns 3 because that is the index number of the first instance
  # of 5 in the array
  
  2. arr.index[5]

  # returns an error because it mixes square brackets with the 
  # index method

  3. arr[5]
  
  # returns 8 because that is the number in the array with the 
  # index number of 5
